# TensorFlow Lite image classification model store

The TensorFlow Lite image classification model store (variant.TensorFlowLite.ImageClassification.ModelStore) is a machine learning model component that contains a pre-trained MobileNet v1 model as a Greengrass artifact. The sample model used in this component is fetched from the TensorFlow Hub and implemented using TensorFlow Lite. The TensorFlow Lite image classification inference component uses this component as a dependency for the model source.
