# TensorFlow Lite object detection model store

The TensorFlow Lite object detection model store (variant.TensorFlowLite.ObjectDetection.ModelStore) is a machine learning model component that contains a pre-trained Single Shot Detection (SSD) MobileNet model as a Greengrass artifact. The sample model used in this component is fetched from the TensorFlow Hub and implemented using TensorFlow Lite. The TensorFlow Lite object detection inference component uses this component as a dependency for the model source.
